1. Main Components of a Computer System
A computer system consists of four primary components:

CPU (Central Processing Unit): The "brain" that executes instructions.

Memory (RAM): Temporary storage for active programs and data.

Storage (HDD/SSD): Long-term storage for files and software.

Motherboard: The main circuit board connecting all components.

Power Supply Unit (PSU): Provides power to the system.

Input/Output Devices: Peripherals like keyboards, monitors, etc.

2. Difference Between RAM and Storage
RAM (Random Access Memory)	Storage (HDD/SSD)
Volatile (loses data when powered off)	Non-volatile (retains data)
Fast access speeds (nanoseconds)	Slower (milliseconds for HDDs)
Used for active tasks and running programs	Stores files, OS, and software long-term
Limited capacity (typically 8GB–64GB)	Larger capacity (500GB–10TB+)
Expensive per GB	Cheaper per GB
3. How the CPU Processes Instructions
The CPU follows the fetch-decode-execute cycle:

Fetch: Retrieves the next instruction from RAM.

Decode: Interprets the instruction (e.g., arithmetic operation).

Execute: Performs the operation using the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).

Store: Writes results back to RAM or registers.

Modern CPUs use pipelining (parallel processing of instructions) and multiple cores for efficiency.

4. Common Computer Peripherals & Functions
